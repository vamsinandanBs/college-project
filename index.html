              <h3>Dr K. R. Paramahamsa</h3>
              <p>
                Tech Samachar is particularly important as it encourages the students to share
                  the knowledge they have acquired. Writing articles for the Newsletter also
                  improves the communication skills of the budding engineers of the Computer
                  Science and Engineering Department. It is common knowledge that
                  representation of an idea is as important as, if not more important, than the idea
                  itself.
                  Tech Samachar aims to inspire and nurture upcoming Engineers to bring a
                  revolution in this ever-evolving world of Technology. The Newsletter captures the
                  current Technological advancements.
                  To conclude I would like to congratulate the faculty and the students of the
                  editorial team on bringing out this Issue of Tech Samachar. I am glad to see that
                  they have lived up to the high standards and my best wishes to the students for a
                  bright future.

              <h3>Dr. V. S. Ramamurthy</h3>
              <p>
                Congratulations to the students and faculty associated to Newsletter
                committee for successfully publishing this Issue of Departmental Technical
                Newsletter Tech Samachar. Tech Samachar is creating platform which
                provides an opportunity to the students and staff to express their original
                thoughts on Technical topics.
                The Newsletter plays an important role in providing exposure to the students
                to develop written communication skills and command over the language. It
                is a step towards building professional and ethical attitude in them. The
                entire journey of creating Tech Samachar is an outcome of rigorous effort
                made by students and faculty. Students not only gain the knowledge about
                the latest technological developments and advancements through reading
                and writing articles but they also develop verbal and written communication
                skills.
                On concluding note, I would like to thank all the stakeholders for their
                involvement and encouragement and wish All the Best for their bright future.

              <p>
                This is the Second Issue of the Computer Science and Engineering Department
                  Newsletter. Tech Samachar is all about the technology that motivates students
                  to do something, that leaves an eternal mark on the world of Technology.
                  Thus, it was our job to ensure inspiring technological developments are being
                  brought to the students of CEC, by the students of CEC itself.
                  The work was performed in an organized, almost professional manner and
                  credits to my entire Tech Samachar team, for their admirable job.
                  I would also like to Thank every member of the Tech Samachar team, without
                  whose contribution, this issue would not have been possible. I hope you enjoy
                  reading this Newsletter as much as I enjoyed working towards its creation and
                  more importantly, I hope that the articles in this magazine inspire you.
